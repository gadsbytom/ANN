## Customisable Artificial Neural Network:
---
### Description:
#### A python implementation of a Dense, Feed Forward Neural Network

* Command Line Interface to build

* Customise number of hidden layers in the network, and the activation function used

* Prints out loss metrics over time

---
### Resources

* main - code which collates user input determining network structure

* training - code which runs feed forward and backprop for X no. of epochs

* ann_feed_forward - code which runs the feed forward loop through the network

* ann_backprop - code which updates the weights matrices


---
### How to Use:

* `python __main__.py`
