## Customisable Artificial Neural Network:
---
### Description:
#### A python implementation of a Dense, Feed Forward Neural Network

* Command Line Interface to build

* Customise number of hidden layers in the network, and the activation function used

* Prints out loss metrics over time

---
### Resources

* `__main__.py` - code which collates user input determining network structure

* `training.py` - code which runs feed forward and backprop for X no. of epochs

* `ann_feed_forward.py` - code which runs the feed forward loop through the network

* `ann_backprop.py` - code which updates the weights matrices


---
### How to Use:

* `python __main__.py`
* You'll be prompted to set the structure of the network
